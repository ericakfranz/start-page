# Local Browser Start Page

I only uploaded this because a buddy wanted to use it and it was easier to just put it in a public repo. All of my links are still in place for now.

**It's intended for local use as a "New Tab" page.**

### Setting As New Tab Page

I use Chrome. Apparently, there's no setting for the New Page URL. :rage: Instead, there's a setting for the **Home Button** which displays up by the URL bar. Clicking that will take you to whatever page you have it set as.

Here's the deal, though. That's not the same thing as the New Tab page. Likewise, the Home Button uses the default Chrome New Tab page by default. This means you can't actually set the New Tab page. So lame.

What I did was find a Chrome extension that redirects the New Tab to a URL (my local URL). Cool. But there are a few drawbacks:

* After the redirect, the focus is no longer in the URL bar.
* The redirect takes a little longer.
* If you're like me and open a new tab specifically to search Google, just cry.

What I did on this page was add a standard Google search form (not a site search, just a web search) and set the cursor to autofocus in that search field. It's not TOO bad. Still sucks, though.

### Favicons

I'm using Google's little favicon finder tool thing. http://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=

So in the arrays found in `sites.php`, just add the domain of the site as the value of the `favicon` array key (after the variable, of course) and let Google work.

_Note: Trello and Dropbox were acting funky and didn't return favicons. So I made the images and put them in place myself because try to stop me._

### Screenshots

Here's a preview with all my personal links in place:

### Final Words

Ummm... please don't take this seriously. Just take it and do stuff with it if you want to.
